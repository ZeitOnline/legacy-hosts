          <em>Lesen Sie diesen Text auf Deutsch</em>
        </a>
        <br/>
      </p>
      <p>Is there reason to worry? No,
thought Nikolaus Sieveking, an employee at Hamburg’s World Economy Archive. "I
find the act of viewing Hitler’s chancellorship as a sensational event to be
childish enough that I will leave that to his loyal followers," he wrote in his
diary <a href="#" name="_SG_f62fe8a29e374a4e970629ceae5a8fec" target="_blank">on Jan. 30</a>, 1933.</p>
      <p>Like Sieveking, many Germans
didn’t initially recognize this date as a dramatic turning point. Few sensed
what Hitler’s appointment as chancellor actually meant, and many reacted to the
event with shocking indifference. </p>
      <p>The chancellor of the
presidential cabinet had changed twice in 1932 -- Heinrich Brüning was replaced
in early June by Franz von Papen, who was replaced in early December by Kurt
von Schleicher. People had almost gotten used to this tempo. Why should the
Hitler government be anything more than just an episode?  In the <em>Wochenschau</em>
news programs shown in cinemas, the swearing-in of the new cabinet came last,
after the major sporting events.</p>
      <p>This, despite the fact that
Hitler had plainly explained in "Mein Kampf" and countless speeches before 1933
what he wanted to do once in power: to abolish the democratic "system" of
Weimar Germany, to "eradicate" Marxism (by which he meant both social democracy
and communism) and to "remove" the Jews from Germany. As for foreign policy, he
made no secret of the fact that he wanted to revise the Versailles Treaty and
that his long-term goal was the conquering of "Lebensraum in the East."</p>
      <p>German President Paul von
Hindenburg’s camarilla, which had hoisted him to power through a series of
intrigues, agreed with Hitler’s goals of preventing a return to parliamentary
democracy, of cutting the chains of the Versailles Treaty, massively arming the
military and once again making Germany the dominant power in Europe. As for the
rest of Hitler’s stated intentions, his conservative coalition partners were
inclined to dismiss them as mere rhetoric. Once he was in power, they argued,
he would become more reasonable. They also believed they had "framed in" Hitler
in a way that would enable his ambitions for power and the dynamics of his
movement to be kept in check. "What do you want?" Vice Chancellor Papen, the
actual architect of the <a href="#" name="_SG_c5727223201e4496b015c4605680df71" target="_blank">January
30</a> coalition, asked critics. "I have the confidence of Hindenburg! In two
months, we’ll have pushed Hitler so far into the corner that he’ll squeal." </p>
      <p>Hitler’s thirst for power
couldn’t have been more grossly underestimated. The nine conservative ministers
in the so-called "Cabinet of National Concentration" clearly carried more
weight than the three National Socialists. But Hitler also made sure that two
key ministries were filled by his men. Wilhelm Frick took over the Ministry of
the Interior of the German Reich.
Hermann Göring became a cabinet minister without a portfolio, but also
Prussia’s interior minister, thus acquiring power over the police in Germany’s
largest state -- an important precondition for the establishment of the Nazi
dictatorship.</p>
      <p>Media mogul and head of the
German National People’s Party Alfred Hugenberg was seen as the strongman in
the cabinet. He was given the Ministry of Economy and Agriculture of both the Reich and Prussia. The new super minister
purportedly told Leipzig Mayor Carl Goerdeler he had made the "biggest mistake"
of his life by aligning himself with the "biggest demagogue in world history,"
but his assertion is hard to believe. Hugenberg, like Papen and the remaining
conservative ministers, was convinced that he could steer Hitler to go along
with his own ideas.<a href="#" name="_GoBack" target="_blank"/></p>
      <p>Big-business representatives
shared the same illusion. In an editorial in the <em>Deutsche Allgemeine Zeitung</em>, which had close ties to heavy
industry, editor-in-chief Fritz Klein wrote that working together with the
Nazis would be "difficult and exhausting," but that people had to dare to take
"the leap into darkness" because the Hitler movement had become the strongest
political actor in Germany. The head of the Nazi party would now have to prove
"whether he really had what is needed in order to become a statesman." The
stock market didn’t seem spooked either -- people were waiting to see what
would happen.</p>
      <p>The conservatives who helped
Hitler rise to power, and his opponents in the republican camp, were wrong in
their assessment of the true division of power. On Jan. 31, Harry Graf Kessler,
the diplomat and arts patron, reported having a conversation with Hugo Simon, a
former close colleague of Foreign Minister Walther Rathenau, who was murdered
in 1922. "He sees Hitler as a prisoner of Hugenberg and Papen." Apparently
Kessler felt similarly, because only a few days later he prophesized that the
new government wouldn’t last long, since it was only held together by the
"Papen’s cream puffery and intrigues." He argued, "Hitler must have noticed by
now that he has fallen prey to a deception. He is bound, hand and foot, to this
government and can move neither forward nor backward."</p>
    </division>
    <division type="page" teaser="&quot;The signs are pointing to a storm&quot;">
      <p>In his book "Defying Hitler,"
written in exile in England in 1939, journalist Sebastian Haffner recalled the
"icy horror" he felt when he had learned of Hitler’s appointment while working
as a clerk at the Kammergericht court in Berlin six years earlier. For a
moment, he had "physically sensed (Hitler’s) odor of blood and filth." But
on the evening of Jan. 30, he discussed the views of the new government with
his father, a liberal progressive-educator, and they quickly agreed that while
the cabinet could do a lot of damage, it couldn’t stay in power for very long.
"A deeply reactionary government, with Hitler as its mouthpiece. Apart from
this, it did not really differ much from the two governments that had succeeded
Brüning's. … No, all things considered, this government was not a cause for
alarm." </p>
      <p>The big liberal newspapers
also argued that nothing truly terrible would happen. Theodor Wolff, the
editor-in-chief of the <em>Berliner Tageblatt</em>
saw the cabinet as the embodiment of what the united right-wing political
groups had wanted since their meeting in Bad Harzburg in 1931. He opened his
editorial on Jan. 31 by
writing: "It has been achieved. Hitler is the Reich Chancellor, Hugenberg is
the economics dictator and the positions have been distributed as the men of
the ‘Harzburger Front’ had wanted." The new government, he argued, would try
anything to "intimidate and silence opponents." A ban on the Communist Party
was on the agenda, he thought, as well as a curtailing of the freedom of the
press. But even the imagination of this otherwise so clear-sighted journalist
didn’t go far enough to conceive the power of a totalitarian dictatorship. He
argued there was a "border that violence would not cross." The German people,
who were always proud of the "freedom of thought and of speech," would create a
"soulful and intellectual resistance" and stifle all attempts to establish a
dictatorship.</p>
      <p>In the <em>Frankfurter Zeitung</em>, politics editor Benno Reifenberg expressed
doubt Hitler had the "social competence" for the office of chancellor, but
didn’t think it was out of the question that the responsibility of his office
might transform him in ways that could earn him respect. Like Theodor Wolff,
Reifenberg described it as "a hopeless misjudgment of our country to believe a
dictatorial regime could be forced upon it." "The diversity of the German
people demands democracy," he wrote.</p>
      <p>Julius Elbau, the
editor-in-chief of the <em>Vossischer
Zeitung</em>, displayed less
optimism. "The signs are pointing to a storm," he wrote in his first
commentary. Although Hitler wasn’t able to achieve the absolute power he sought
-- "it is not a Hitler cabinet, but a Hitler-Papen-Hugenberg government" --
this triumvirate was in agreement, despite all of their inner contradictions<a href="#" name="_SG_b91c03edae8c4e6390be57971ba3b3b2" target="_blank">, that</a> they wanted to make a
"complete break from all that had come before." Given this prospect, the
newspaper warned that it constituted "a dangerous experiment, which one can
only watch with deep concern and the strongest suspicion."</p>
      <p>The left was also concerned.
In their appeal <a href="#" name="_SG_7527b9b9694d4388a6fcb0a01250c69d" target="_blank">on Jan. 30</a>,
the party executive of the Social Democrats and their Reichstag parliamentary
group called for supporters to carry out a "fight on the basis of the
constitution." Every attempt by the new government to damage the constitution,
they argued, "will be met with the most extreme resistance of the working class
and all elements of the population who love freedom." </p>
      <p>With their strict insistence
on the legalities of the constitution, the Social Democratic Party (SPD)
leadership overlooked the fact that the previous presidential governments had
already hollowed the constitution and that Hitler would not hesitate to destroy
its last vestiges.</p>
      <p>The Communist Party of
Germany (KPD) also made a misjudgment in its call for a "general strike against
the fascist dictatorship of Hitler, Hugenberg, Papen." Given that there were 6
million unemployed people in Germany, few had the desire to go on strike. The
call to build a common line of defense also wasn’t very popular with the Social
Democrats, whom the Communists had defamed as "social fascists" only a short
time earlier.</p>
      <p>The idea of taking action
outside of parliament was just as far from the unions’ minds. "Organization --
not demonstration: That is the word of the hour!" Theodor Leipart, the head of
the General German Trade Union, said on Jan. 31. In the views of the
representatives of the social-democratic workers’ movement, Hitler was a
henchman of the old socially reactionary power-elites -- large landowners in
the eastern Elbe region and the Rhineland-Westphalian heavy industry. In a talk
in early February 1933, SPD Reichstag lawmaker Kurt Schumacher described the
Nazi leader as being merely a "decoration piece." "The cabinet has Hitler’s
name on the masthead, but in reality the cabinet is Alfred Hugenberg. Adolf
Hitler may make the speeches, but Hugenberg will act."</p>
      <p>The dangers emanating from
Hitler could not have been more grotesquely misread. Most of the leading Social
Democrats and unionists had grown up in the German
Kaiserreich. They could imagine repression similar to Bismarck’s
anti-socialist law, but not that someone would seriously try to destroy the
workers’ movement in its entirety.</p>
    </division>
    <division type="page" teaser="Hitler needed only five months">
      <p>The fact that Hitler’s
appointment meant that a fanatical anti-Semite had come to power should have
made Germany’s Jews, above all, nervous. But that was not the case at all. In a
statement given on Jan. 30,
the chair of the Central Association of German Citizens of Jewish Faith said,
"In general, today more than
ever we must follow the directive: wait calmly." He said that although one
watches the new government "of course with deep suspicion," President Hindenburg represents the "calming influence."
He said there was no reason to doubt his "sense of justice" and "loyalty to the
constitution." As a result, he said, one should be convinced that "nobody would
dare" to "touch our constitutional rights." In an editorial in the <em>Jüdische Rundschau</em>, a Jewish newspaper,<em> </em>published on Jan. 31, the author argued
that "there are powers that are still awake in the German people that will rear
up against barbarian anti-Jewish policies." It would only be a few weeks before
all these expectations would prove to be illusory. </p>
      <p>Foreign diplomats also made
false assumptions about the nature of the change of power. The American consul
general in Berlin, George S. Messersmith, believed that it was difficult to
make a clear prediction about the future of the Hitler government and spoke of
his assumption that it represented a transitional phenomenon on the road to a
more stable political situation. To British Ambassador Horace Rumbold, it
seemed like the conservatives had managed to successfully fence in the Nazis.
But he also predicted that there would soon be conflicts between the unequal
coalition partners because Papen’s and Hugenberg’s goal of restoring the
monarchy could not be reconciled with Hitler’s plans. He recommended that the
Foreign Office should take a wait-and-see attitude toward the new government.</p>
      <p>French Ambassador Andre François-Poncet
called the Hitler-Papen-Hugenberg cabinet a "bold experiment," but he also
suggested his government remain calm and wait for further developments. When he
met Hitler in the evening of Feb. 8 during a reception held by the German
president for the diplomatic corps, he was relieved. The new chancellor seemed
"dull and mediocre," a kind of miniature Mussolini. </p>
      <p>The Swiss envoy, Paul
Dinichert, heard about Hitler’s appointment as he was eating lunch with some
"elevated German personalities." He described the reactions in his dispatch to
Bern thusly: "Heads were shaken. ‘How long can this last?’ -- ‘It could have
been worse.’" Dinichert recognized, correctly, that Papen was the puppet master
behind the installation of the new cabinet. But, like most other commentators,
he was wrong in describing the outcome: "Hitler, who for years insisted on
ruling by himself, has been yoked, hemmed in or constrained (take your pick)
with two of his disciples between Papen and Hindenburg." </p>
      <p>Rarely has a political project
so rapidly been revealed to be a chimera as the idea that the conservatives
would "tame" the Nazis. In terms of tactical cunning, Hitler towered high above
his cabinet allies and opponents. In a short time, he had upstaged them and
driven them against the wall, dislodging Papen from of his preferential
position with Hindenburg and forcing Hugenberg to resign.</p>
      <p>Hitler needed only five
months to establish his power. By the summer of 1933, fundamental rights and
the constitution had been suspended, the states had been forced into
conformity, the unions crushed, the political parties banned or dissolved,
press and radio brought into line and the Jews stripped of their equality under
the law. Everything that existed in Germany outside of the National Socialist
Party had been "destroyed, dispersed, dissolved, annexed or absorbed,"
François-Poncet concluded in early July. Hitler, he claimed, had "won the game
with little effort." "He only had to puff -- and the edifice of German politics
collapsed like a house of cards."</p>
