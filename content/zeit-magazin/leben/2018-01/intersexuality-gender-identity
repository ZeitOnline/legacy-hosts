      </p>
      <p>You're 18 and
you've fallen in love with a boy for the first time. You want to sleep with
him, but you realize that it's not quite that easy. Doctors tell you that what
you thought was your vagina is only two centimeters deep. In order to make
sexual intercourse possible, you must first undergo an operation. So, you do.
But intercourse still doesn't work and your boyfriend leaves you.</p>
      <p>Your parents say
nothing.</p>
      <p>Your hair falls
out. All of it. From your head, from everywhere on your body, your eyelashes,
eyebrows and pubic hair. Doctors even have a name for the condition, for
stress-triggered hair loss: alopecia universalis. But they don't have one for
you, for what you are. They also don't have an explanation for the most
important question of all: Why are you what you are?</p>
      <p>But that's not
the worst part. The worst is the loneliness. The feeling that you are an
annoyance, something abnormal. Something that has no place in this world. A
monster.</p>
      <p>Maxi
Bauermeister, a 33-year-old farmer who is 1.64 meters (5'7") tall and
weighs 50 kilos (110 pounds), is sitting in the large kitchen of a farmhouse in
the German state of Brandenburg telling – and this is where things start to get
difficult – his story? Telling her story? Neither is accurate. Bauermeister is
neither a man nor a woman. And Bauermeister isn't a fan of personal pronouns. On
the playground as a child, other children sometimes used to call Bauermeister a
hermaphrodite. Recently, society has begun using the rather unwieldy term
"intersex people" to describe those like Bauermeister. Bauermeister
occasionally jokingly uses the term "divinely randy hermaphrodite,"
but since Bauermeister's story isn't particularly humorous, this story will
often use "Bauermeister" instead of gender specific pronouns (<em>see editor's note below</em>).</p>
      <p>Last November,
Germany's Constitutional Court ruled that official documents must add a third
gender choice, such as "other" or "various," arguing that
the lack of such a choice is discriminatory. It was a revolutionary ruling.
"Societal acceptance cannot be mandated by a court ruling, but it is a
step in the right direction," said Vanja, the plaintiff in the case, who
was supported by the campaign Dritte Option, or "Third Option." It is
a view that many around the world have echoed. "The landmark ruling
injects clarity and sobriety into an often ill-informed and ideologically
poisoned debate about gender in Germany," wrote the <em>New York Times</em>.</p>
      <p>It is the first legal
ruling of its kind in Europe. For the first time, an open discussion has been
triggered about a reality that has been around since times immemorial: the lack
of clear sexual determinacy. In Greek mythology, Hermaphroditus is the figure
whose body exhibits both male and female characteristics. According to
estimates from support groups, there are around 160,000 such people in Germany
– a total that hardly anyone is aware of, often not even those affected. It may
sound incomprehensible that there are people out there who don't know what
their real sex is. But it's true.</p>
      <p>Intersexuality
was long a taboo. In 2003, the American author Jeffrey Eugenides won the
Pulitzer Prize for his bestseller "Middlesex," which described the
life of an intersex person. His book is widely considered one of the most
important novels of the 21st century – but it didn't trigger a broader societal
debate. It has only been since the more recent discussions about gender
identity, about transgender and gay marriage, about all manner of identities
that deviate from the binary man or woman, hetero- or homosexual – it has only
been since the debate has widened to address what it really means to be
masculine or feminine that intersex people have also finally become a topic of
conversation as well.</p>
      <p>Maxi
Bauermeister is not the kind of person who seeks out attention. On the
contrary. It was difficult to even find Bauermeister in the first place because
few intersex people in Germany are interested in talking about themselves, and
certainly not with their real names and a photo. The Association for Intersex
People has even prepared an extensive list of questions and conditions that
journalists must first address before the group is even willing to consider
their requests. That says quite a bit about the degree of ostracism, derision,
rejection and lack of understanding that intersex people are confronted with.</p>
      <p>Bauermeister,
though, is willing to talk, in the hope that openly addressing the "third
unique sex" will help inform people and awaken understanding "so that
doctors one day will tell parents after the birth of an intersex child: 'It's
not a problem, nothing has to be done. It is a healthy child.
Congratulations!'" That's not what happened in Bauermeister's case.</p>

      <p>It is a mild
winter morning with the gray sky hanging low as sheep and goats graze in the
field behind a row of birch trees. The secluded organic farming cooperative
where Bauermeister is a partner produces cheese, herbs and vegetables, which
are sold at local markets. Bauermeister is wearing a loose sweater, workpants
and a cap. Tea stands ready on the table. The voice is bright, but masculine,
the product of the testosterone pills that Bauermeister has taken every morning
for several years, much like others take their vitamins.</p>
      <p>Bauermeister has
adopted a masculine demeanor and dresses like a man, though he's not taking testosterone
because he wants to become a man, but because it provides his body with
something it is unable to produce itself due to the lack of gonads. Since he began
taking testosterone, he feels better – more balanced and calmer.</p>

    <division type="page" teaser="&quot;My Genitals Didn't Adhere to the Norm&quot;">
      <p>Maximiliane Maria Bauermeister was born in West Berlin in October 1984. The
pregnancy was a complicated one and the baby did not develop properly. Because of an irregular heartbeat, a Cesarean section was performed a month before the due date. The newborn was light, just under four pounds, but otherwise healthy. "But it was apparently obvious that I wasn't a boy or a girl," Bauermeister says. "My genitals didn't adhere to the norm." What did
they look like? "I don't know much about it. There are surely pictures somewhere, but I've never seen any. I'm in the process of trying to find all that out. I had a kind of skin flap that apparently didn't much resemble a penis, and undescended testicles. My chromosomes were male."</p>
      <p>Shortly before
Maxi's second birthday, the implementation of a plan to turn Maxi into a girl
began. "A vagina was constructed using the ambiguous genitalia. I was
forcibly castrated, with the testicles and everything removed." Additional
operations followed, though Bauermeister doesn't know how many precisely. Nor
does Bauermeister know exactly what the doctors did or how urination was
possible initially. When Maxi was 11, estrogen was prescribed "because I
had begun developing more like a male." Only vague explanations were given
for why she had to take the drops, even though they caused her to vomit almost
every morning. "The voice, the breasts, the psyche: All of it was supposed
to become more feminine." Because nothing was happening on its own.
Breasts began to grow as a result of the hormone drops and they are still there
today. The only way to get rid of them would be yet another operation. The fact
that she never began menstruating was never discussed.</p>
      <p>Even as a young
child, Maxi refused to wear girl's clothes. For as long as she can remember,
she has been shrouding herself in hoodies. She never wanted to change at the
beach, and her mother always had to have plenty of towels on hand to wrap her in.
She never wanted to play with dolls and princesses, and she usually wore her
hair short or in dreadlocks. She changed schools three times. "When I was
13, I was sent to a boarding school, and I stayed there until I finished
school. It was terrible. I wanted to be with my parents, but I didn't get along
with them. I never questioned being a girl, but my theory is that I noticed
that something wasn't quite right. So, I acted out."</p>
      <p>Maxi's punk-rock
phase began at boarding school. As a punk, you don't have to look like a girl.
She was happiest when she was surrounded by animals, and she barely spoke at
all. Not even with her parents, who she saw every four weeks. But her parents
didn't talk to her, either. Not even on the eve of the traumatic operation she
had when she was 18. The doctors told Maxi vaguely: You won't be able to have
any children because you don't have any ovaries. But, they added, that's not
such a big deal. It's a problem many women have.</p>
      <p>There was nobody
Maxi could speak to about all that.</p>
      <p>When
Bauermeister talks about the years spent living as a girl, the tone of voice is
calm and matter-of-fact. No stammering, no crying, not even when talking about
that operation as an 18-year-old – one that was far from the last one and which
was "quite a catastrophe." There were infections and two additional
operations, followed by years of painful dilation treatment to enlarge the
artificial vagina. Bauermeister only takes occasional respites from narrating
the story to go outside for a cigarette. Or to take a bathroom break. A weak
bladder is another of the lasting side effects of the plan to construct a girl,
as if there were some sort of blueprint.</p>
      <p>It is difficult
to imagine parents leaving their child in the dark about its own identity. Leaving
the child alone with all these problems. Were there no discussions? "At
some point, my mother confronted the subject. For my father, it was difficult
from the very beginning because he was opposed to the operations and my parents
never lived together, although they otherwise raised me together. I still can't
talk with him about it." But how could the mother have ignored for so long
the fact that her child was unhappy, constantly changing schools, got
increasingly poor grades and had few friends? "We can ask her. She now
believes that the operations were a mistake, too."</p>

      <p>Two weeks later,
we meet Christiane Bauermeister. She lives in a small, basement apartment full
of books and pictures in an old villa on the outskirts of Berlin. She is a
petite, elegant woman wearing red lipstick and gold rings on her fingers. She
has a degree in Slavic studies and has written a number of travel guides, in
addition to having done numerous radio shows. Today, she and Maxi have a very
close relationship.</p>
      <p>Christiane
Bauermeister provides a few more details to Maxi's story. "I was 37 when
she was born, rather old. I suffered a lot of bleeding and often had to lie in
the clinic. The doctors didn't know why the child didn't develop properly
during the pregnancy. " One day, after an ultrasound, the doctor said: The
penis isn't deducible, which he also wrote in her pregnancy file. "But I
somehow never asked what that means. Though after the trisomy 21 (<em>eds. Note: Down syndrome</em>) test, the
chromosome make-up was also clear. XY, masculine."</p>
      <p>Maxi
Bauermeister is sitting attentively on the sofa with the dog sleeping nearby.
The tea on the table is slowly getting cold.</p>
      <p>When Christiane
Bauermeister arrived at Maxi's incubator in the maternity ward four days after
giving birth, it was empty. But there was a note hanging there, reading:
"Prematurely born with defects. Hermaphroditic genitalia. Suspicion of
pseudo-hermaphroditism." A nurse told her: "The child is being shown
to medical students in the lecture hall." She ran over to the lecture hall
and managed to prevent the show-and-tell session. And she also blocked out the
note she had found on the bed for the time being.</p>
      <p>The next day, a
doctor told her: "We recommend that you raise the child as a girl, because
it will never be able to pee standing up and will never have a satisfying sex
life." Another doctor suggested: "Just pierce the ears, then the
child will grow up as a girl."</p>
      <p>The mother
didn't trust the advice. She officially registered her child as a girl, but she
took her child across Germany to the leading specialists of the time, to Munich
and to Bonn. All the doctors strongly recommended that she have her child
operated on to prevent social ostracism later on. But the doubts persisted.</p>
      <p>One-and-a-half
years later, when Maxi was in a left-wing alternative kindergarten, the father
of another child asked: What kind of a flap is that hanging between Maxi's
legs? That's the moment when Christiane Bauermeister decided in favor of an
operation. "I called it a flap myself, the thing Maxi had and out of which
she urinated." Turning to Maxi, she says: "But I never thought that
it was a rudimentary penis, like you always think. I just didn't want people to
constantly be staring between your legs when you were naked."</p>
      <p>"My testicles
had already descended out of my abdomen," Maxi answers. "Healthy
testicles. I would ultimately have been able to reproduce."  </p>
      <p>"I didn't
know that."</p>
      <p>"It says so
in the file. You must have seen it at some point."</p>
      <p>"I didn't
see anything. It was all so small."</p>
      <p>The longer
Christiane Bauermeister talks about Maxi's story, the more gaps appear in her
version. She digresses and talks about how wild Maxi was and that she,
"with a heavy heart," decided to send Maxi to the Waldorf boarding
school because she thought she wouldn't stand out as much in the large classes
that were typical at the institution. She says she only wanted Maxi to be
happy.</p>
      <p>Then, suddenly,
she says: "I was too scared to tell you all that directly. There is a lot
I can't remember, or don't want to. I thought at the time: girl, girl, girl,
that's where we have to go. I never asked: Have you been discriminated against?
Are you unhappy? I wanted everything to be fine. I never had the courage to
say: You aren't a girl. I only raised you that way. You are intersex."</p>
      <p>"Maybe you
didn't really know yourself back then," Maxi says. "I have realized
over and over again that when it comes to questions about my early childhood,
there is a kind of blackout."</p>
      <p>The mother
stands up and retrieves framed photos from her desk. Maxi at eight, in jeans
and short hair. A good-looking boy. Another of Maxi sleeping at age 17, the
hair a bit longer. It is impossible to tell whether the picture shows a girl or
a boy. "Was there ever a time when you noticed a feminine development in
me?" Maxi asks his mother. "No. The worst was the school graduation
dance. You had to take dance classes and wear a dress and high heels. I noticed
that it looked completely wrong. It was a turning point and I slowly began to
confront the issue. Very slowly."</p>
      <p>It is an
extremely intimate moment between a mother and her child, but one which makes
it clear the accusations that must have been leveled in the past and how often
guilt, remorse, failure, responsibility, mistakes and helplessness must have
been discussed. How difficult it must have been when all of that was suddenly
up for discussion and nothing was certain anymore, identity least of all. And
it is impressive how openly the two can talk about it with each other. And how
lovingly.</p>

      <p>Christiane
Bauermeister heard the word intersexuality for the first time at an art
exhibition on gender. It was 2005 and Maxi was 20 years old. As she was gazing
at the works of art, she suddenly realized what had been done to the children,
to her child. "There were pictures of destroyed vaginas, destroyed
penises," she says. "Self-portraits of those affected, who had been
labeled by society as abnormal."</p>
      <p>At a Christmas
party at the German Academic Exchange Service, to which she was invited to a
short time later, Bauermeister met Jeffrey Eugenides, who was also in
attendance. She told him that she also has a child like the one in his book.
"I bought another copy and asked him to sign it." She gets up again,
pulls "Middlesex" off a shelf and opens it up. "To Maxi,"
it says.</p>
      <p>In 2007, a
documentary film about intersex people ran at the Berlin International Film
Festival, "and my mother suggested that we go together," Maxi
continues. "It was intense. Everything I had never talked about was
suddenly there on screen. I cried the whole time, three-and-a-half hours,
that's how long the film was. I was emotionally exhausted. After the film,
there was a podium discussion with the Austrian main character, and she said
that there were support groups in Germany. Not long later, I went to one
myself."</p>
      <p>"But you
did something else first," the mother interrupts. "After the movie
ended, you jumped up and yelled: 'I'm also intersex!' The word wasn't yet in
common usage at the time. People referred to it as 'hermaphroditism.'"
Christiane Bauermeister also cried during the movie, and her eyes fill with
tears once again as she talks about it. "It was so great that Maxi stood
up and self-identified. It was an incredible relief for both of us because we
could suddenly speak openly about everything."</p>
      <p>In the support
groups that Maxi went to after seeing the film, Bauermeister finally learned
that there were other intersex people in the world and he wasn't alone.
"That's where my healing process began. The best kind of help is to talk
with others in the same situation." Bauermeister was in his mid-20s before
the realization arrived: I'm not a monster after all.</p>
      <p>Christiane
Bauermeister says she has only been able to talk about Maxi's fate for the last
four years. She has since become active in associations and groups and she
speaks at conferences and symposiums. "It is so enriching to see how young
parents deal with intersex children. One acquaintance of mine went to the
school and spoke with the teacher – and then they enlightened the entire class
on the issue. And the children didn't seem all that interested. It wasn't a
problem for them. I am curious to see how it will be in puberty, that's still
coming. But society is on the right track."</p>

      <p>But is it? Perhaps Ulrike Klöppel can
answer the question. She's a psychologist and gender researcher at the
Institute for European Ethnology at Berlin's Humboldt University and one of
Germany's leading experts on the medical treatment of intersex people and how
the issue is dealt with politically. Gender-assignment operations on children
have been conducted in Germany since the 1970s, but today they have become
extremely controversial. We met up for an interview at a café near her
apartment.</p>
      <p>"The medical treatment of intersex
people was quite violent up until the year 2000 and beyond," Klöppel says.
"People whose genitalia were seen as ambiguous were described as
monstrous. Even today, this idea continues to shape the perception of sexual
indeterminacy. I find it strange that medical science has declared intersex
people to be a problem. Step by step, it has sought to take control of an issue
that should actually be addressed by society. It's called medicalization."</p>
      <p>Some doctors say that a paradigm shift has
already taken place in terms of cosmetic genital operations on children.
"But when you discuss the experiences intersex people have had when
talking about the issue with their parents, a different image emerges."</p>
      <citation layout="short" text="The number of those saying that what was done to them was the worst thing that could have happened is constantly increasing." attribution="Ulrike Klöppel, gender researcher at the Institute for European Ethnology at Berlin's Humboldt University"/>
      <p>The conclusions of a recently released
study by Klöppel can be summed up as follows: The number of intersex diagnoses
dropped between 2005 and 2014, but varieties of diagnoses pertaining to altered
genitalia remained the same or increased. Traditional diagnoses like true hermaphroditism
(the presence of testicles and ovaries in one person) and
pseudo-hermaphroditism (the presence of unusually formed genitalia) are being
made less frequently. This could be the result of advancements in genetic
analysis and hormone tests. But it is also possible that reasons given for
carrying out the operations have changed due to the heavy criticism surrounding
them. After all, the frequency of cosmetic genital surgeries on children under
the age of 10 has not decreased. Between 2005 and 2014, an average of 1,729 of
these operations took place each year in Germany.</p>
      <p>Klöppel is on the advisory board of the
German chapter of Organization Intersex International (OII). She says she has
recently been hearing more voices in support groups that are critical of the
operations than she did in 2000. And this is not just because a new generation
has joined the support groups, "but because many have started thinking
about themselves in completely different ways and have mustered the courage to
talk about it through their exchange with others. To do so, they must think
critically about the roles their parents played, which doesn't come easy for
many. But the number of those saying that what was done to them was the worst
thing that could have happened is constantly increasing."</p>
      <citation text="Parents need to be given the possibility of learning to view intersex positively." attribution="Maxi Bauermeister" layout="short"/>
      <p>For the past few years, the United Nations
Committee against Torture and Amnesty International have also begun voicing criticism
of these operations and have also called for a ban on cosmetic genital surgery
on children. In 2015, Malta become the world's first and only country to ban
the practice. The logic behind the operations is, indeed, faulty. Babies born
without clear sexual determinacy are considered to be ill – so ill that
circumcision or gender assignment surgery is unavoidable. From a medical
perspective, though, that's not true. In other societal contexts, such
incursions are referred to as mutilation, such as the genital mutilation girls
are subjected to in some countries. In Germany, a heated societal debate broke
out several years ago after a regional court in Cologne ruled that the ritual
circumcision of an underage boy constituted bodily harm.</p>
      <p>Maxi Bauermeister would never see sexual
indeterminacy as being an illness. "Intersex isn't an issue for doctors
alone," Bauermeister says. "The Association for Intersex Persons now
offers peer counseling. Qualified intersex people and their parents travel in
teams of two to parents with an intersex baby to provide them with advice. Some
hospitals are now even telling people about the service," says
Bauermeister. Regular meetings are also held for parents and children,
"because parents also need to be given the possibility of learning to view
intersex positively and not as something that needs to be treated." And
you have to help them get over the fear of discrimination, Bauermeister says.
It's only then, after all, that they can provide their children with the support
they need. "It's about networking and providing children the opportunity
to play and grow up together so they know from the start that they aren't
alone. That gives me hope."</p>

      <p>Maxi Bauermeister will never know what life
might have been like if the operation had never taken place. Officially,
Bauermeister currently has no gender. Since 2013, it has been possible in
Germany to have no gender listed on birth certificates, neither man nor woman.
The given name Maximiliane Marie has also been dropped, with only Maxi
remaining. "I've even thought that I could now introduce myself with:
Hello, I'm the third option. But that's nonsense. A person buying potatoes from
me at the weekly farmers market doesn't want to know any of that."</p>
      <p>Bauermeister deals with his ambiguity as
openly as possible. He likes going to the sauna. "When I go, I use the
women's changing room, but people often look at me in annoyance and say: You're
in the wrong place, young man. But I'm no longer bothered by such comments. I
just say: 'When I take off my clothes, I look like a woman. I'm neither man nor
woman. There's no changing room for me. So please tell me where it is that I
should go?'" He has even begun bringing along brochures from the
organization, which he sometimes hands out. </p>
      <p>Some intersexuals are less relaxed. They
insist on gender neutral forms of address says Maxi, and when speaking to each
other, they use pronouns like "it" or "<em>hen</em>," a gender-neutral pronoun added to the Swedish language
in 2015 that means something along the lines of "in-between." Or they
attach an "-ix" to their first name. Michaelix. Or Annix. Unlike
Bauermeister, however, other intersexuals often learn the truth about
themselves much later and frequently by chance. It can be traumatizing. There
are even support groups that include legally married women whose husbands don't
have the slightest idea about their spouse's actual sex.</p>
      <p>"I also haven't yet found peace with
myself," says Bauermeister. "I think it will remain an issue for my
entire life. But that's also OK. I really do feel somewhere in-between. I have
both in me – man and woman." Bauermeister recently began participating in
a study conducted by the University of Lübeck "in order to obtain a
definitive diagnosis. I want to know why I became how I am." The
fulfilling sex life that the doctors said wouldn't be possible without the
operation is also problematic after the operation. And that doesn't make
relationships any easier. Bauermeister has had a number of them, but on the
long term, they have thus far "proven to be too difficult for those
involved."</p>
      <p>More than two months have passed since the
ruling by Germany's Constitutional Court and, so far at least, it feels like
anything but a fresh start. German Interior Minister Thomas de Maizière, who is
responsible for implementing the ruling, has delayed issuing a far-reaching legal
reform. And yet it still represents a major step for Maxi Bauermeister.
"It's very good having this third option. There's finally something that
you can reference. Earlier, when I would say something about my gender, people
had often never heard anything like that. It's important that society realizes
that there is more than just man and woman." </p>
      <p>One of Maxi's old school friends recently
became a mother and asked Bauermeister to be the godfather. Maxi is currently
thinking about the best word that could be used to describe the relationship.
Auncle? Unclaunt? "You can only change things by dealing with them
openly," says Bauermeister. And so far, Maxi has had positive experiences
with his openness. In the village where he lives in  Brandenburg, for example,
everyone knows. There may only be seven homes there, but it's still a start. <br/></p>
